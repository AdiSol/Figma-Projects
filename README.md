### Intelligent Manufacturing System

Shifu 4.0 can digitize the technical materials in customer production, and use AI machines to learn the manufacturing adjustment techniques of production masters. Master 4.0 can replace the master with adjustment judgment after learning, so that the customer's production capacity Cpk can be improved. The interface entered by the data has a controlled industrial-grade human-machine interface, as well as a web-style interface. Web-style interface allows managers or tubes to see comprehensive information and provide search and other analysis chart functions.
